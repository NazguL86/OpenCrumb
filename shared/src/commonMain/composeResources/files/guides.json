    "content": "This book uses a minimal kneading approach with quick kneading sessions.\n\n**Quick Kneading Method:**\nThe technique of quick mixing times followed by rest periods is efficient and easy to learn. Since you don't spend too much time in the dough mixing phase, you can do other things during the resting periods.\n\n**The Process:**\n1. Initial rough assembly of ingredients (without salt) - rest 10-15 minutes\n2. Series of 3-4 quick hand-kneadings (15-20 seconds each) with 10-minute rests between\n3. Series of 3-4 stretch and folds at 20-minute intervals\n4. Final bulk fermentation rest (45-90 minutes or overnight in fridge)\n\n**Initial Ingredients Assembly:**\n![mix_ingredients1]\n![mix_ingredients2]\n![mix_ingredients3]\n![mix_ingredients4]\n\n1. Put water in mixing bowl (hold back 50g)\n2. Add all ingredients except salt\n3. Mix with sturdy spatula until flour is fully hydrated\n4. Spread salt on dough, pour remaining water\n5. Let rest 10 minutes covered with plastic\n\n**How to Perform Quick Kneading:**\n![quick_kneading1]\n![quick_kneading2]\n![quick_kneading3]\n![quick_kneading4]\n\n1. Slide an oiled or wet hand underneath the dough mass\n2. Stretch it with an outside movement\n3. Take it back towards the dough middle\n4. Turn the bowl around a little and repeat\n5. Make at least 2-3 complete turns around the bowl\n6. Work quickly (15-20 seconds total)\n7. Cover and rest 10 minutes\n8. Repeat 2-3 more times\n\n**For Stiff Doughs (55-65% hydration):**\n- Work on lightly floured surface\n- Knead in classical way: push and stretch with heel of hand\n- Fold back on itself\n- Return to bowl between rests\n\n**For Wet Doughs (70-80% hydration):**\n- Knead directly inside the bowl\n- Keep hand wet (small bowl of water nearby)\n- Or use oil on dough perimeter and hand\n- Oil bowl sides to prevent sticking\n\n**Why This Works:**\nMinimal kneading + resting periods allows gluten to develop naturally through hydration and time, rather than aggressive mechanical action. The short kneading times assemble the dough while the rests allow the gluten structure to form, making the dough smoother and more elastic."

    "title": "Stretch and Fold Method",
    "description": "Master the stretch and fold technique for better gluten development",
    "imageRes": "guide_stretch_fold",
    "content": "Stretch and fold is a gentle technique that builds gluten structure without traditional kneading.\n\n**When to Perform:**\nAfter the last quick kneading, give a 20-minute rest to the dough so it can relax. Then make 3 (or sometimes 4) stretch and folds that will improve the internal distribution of the dough and reinforce the gluten mesh.\n\n**How to Make Stretch and Folds:**\n![stretch_fold1]\n![stretch_fold2]\n![stretch_fold3]\n![stretch_fold4]\n![stretch_fold5]\n![stretch_fold6]\n![stretch_fold7]\n![stretch_fold8]\n![stretch_fold9]\n\n1. Prevent sticking: sprinkle flour or spread oil on work surface (olive oil works well)\n2. Turn dough from bowl onto work surface\n3. With lightly oiled hands, spread dough gently into rough rectangle\n4. Slide scraper under one side, lift and stretch it out\n5. Fold it back to cover the central 1/3 of the mass\n6. Repeat from opposite side (dough now folded in thirds)\n7. Rotate dough 90° and repeat the folding process\n8. Lift dough and flip it back into bowl\n9. Rest 20 minutes\n10. Repeat stretch and fold 2 more times with 20-minute rests between\n\n**Schedule:**\n- Perform 3 stretch and folds total\n- 20-minute rest between each\n- After final fold, rest for time indicated in recipe\n\n**What to Observe:**\nEvery time you make a stretch and fold, the dough becomes stronger and more resistant to stretching. This is a sign that the gluten mesh is forming and expanding.\n\n**For Wet or Weak Flour Doughs:**\nYou can make an extra stretch and fold (4 total instead of 3), adding another 20-minute rest period before the final bulk fermentation.\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Develops gluten gently\n- Incorporates air for open crumb\n- Strengthens dough structure\n- Works especially well for high hydration doughs\n- Improves internal distribution of dough"

Cut dough into 250-300g pieces\n2. Rest 10 minutes covered with plastic sheet\n3. Gently flatten into rectangular shape (about 20x10 cm)\n4. Fold long upper side toward middle of rectangle\n5. Press gently so it adheres to dough\n6. Rotate and repeat folding with other half\n7. Press to seal the two sides\n8. Fold upper side upon other half again\n9. Press sides together with heel of hand\n10. Use fingertips if necessary to improve seal\n11. Using palms like rolling pin, start from center\n12. Roll gently back and forth\n13. Move hands toward external tips\n14. Dough becomes thinner until desired length\n15. Don't elongate too much - can't reshape\n16. Place on perforated metal pan or linen mat\n17. Just before baking, slash with lame or sharp knife\n18. Make 3-4 almost vertical cuts, 1cm deep, 8-10cm long\n\n**Boule (Round Loaf):**\n![round_loaf_shaping1]\n![round_loaf_shaping2]\n![round_loaf_shaping3]\n![round_loaf_shaping4]\n![round_loaf_shaping5]\n![round_loaf_shaping6]\n\n1. Cut dough into 400-500g pieces\n2. Rest 10 minutes covered\n3. Place on lightly floured surface\n4. Flatten lightly in approximate round form\n5. Stretch dough from one side and fold to middle\n6. Repeat until whole piece is stretched and folded\n7. You have tight, smooth ball (bottom becomes top when baked)\n8. Flip dough ball onto non-floured surface\n9. Place hands around half furthest from you\n10. Touch ball with little fingers\n11. Slide toward you while it sticks slightly to surface\n12. Surface tightens - this creates tension\n13. Rotate ball and repeat sliding process\n14. Continue until very smooth and tight ball\n15. Place in round banneton or on parchment paper\n16. Before baking, slash with cross or square cuts\n\n**Ciabatta Shaping:**\n![ciabatta_shaping1]\n![ciabatta_shaping2]\n![ciabatta_shaping3]\n![ciabatta_shaping4]\n![ciabatta_shaping5]\n![ciabatta_shaping6]\n![ciabatta_shaping7]\n![ciabatta_shaping8]\n![ciabatta_shaping9]\n\nShaping ciabattas is usually simple since it doesn't have a particularly formed shape.\n\n**Richard Bertinet Technique for Cutting:**\n1. Place upturned dough on lightly floured surface\n2. Sprinkle flour on it and spread into rough rectangle\n3. Fold side farthest from you to middle\n4. Fold side near you (dough folded in half)\n5. Press lightly on center line where sides meet\n6. Fold farthest side on top again (folded in half again)\n7. Seal lightly with heel of hand\n8. You have a long roll that can be stretched more\n9. Pat lightly along longest sides\n10. Cut into pieces of desired weight (250-300g)\n\n**Final Shaping:**\n1. Let pieces rest 10 minutes\n2. Gently shape into rectangular form, flatten a bit\n3. Fold in thirds (short sides to center)\n4. Use scraper to lift dough\n5. Hold from one side with hand, scraper on other\n6. Flatten slightly\n7. Place on surface sprinkled with flour\n8. Rest 45-60 minutes\n9. Just before baking, elongate again with scraper\n10. Place on metal tray or baking stone\n\n**Key Principle:**\nHandle dough gently to preserve the air bubbles created during fermentation."

High Hydration (70%+)**\n- More water = more steam = bigger holes\n- Requires strong flour to support structure\n\n**2. Strong Flour**\n- High protein content (12-14%)\n- Builds strong gluten network\n- Can hold more water\n\n**3. Gentle Handling**\n- Minimal degassing during shaping\n- Preserve air bubbles from fermentation\n- Use stretch and fold instead of punching\n\n**4. Long Fermentation**\n- Extended cold fermentation (18-48 hours)\n- Develops flavor and structure\n- Creates more gas bubbles\n\n**5. Proper Baking**\n- High initial temperature\n- Steam in first minutes\n- Allows maximum oven spring\n\n**Common Mistakes:**\n- Too much kneading (destroys air pockets)\n- Insufficient hydration\n- Weak flour\n- Over-proofing or under-proofing"
