# Open Crumb

"Open Crumb" is a modern, open-source recipe-keeping application for Android, built entirely with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. The project aims to provide a clean, simple, and delightful user experience for browsing and managing personal recipes.

## Project Scope & Vision

The core goal of this project is to build a beautiful and functional recipe app that follows modern Android development best practices.

The development is planned in phases:

1.  **Foundation (Current Phase):** Build the core UI for browsing recipes. This includes a recipe list screen and a recipe detail screen, populated with local sample data. The focus is on creating a solid architectural base with Jetpack Compose and Navigation.
2.  **User-Created Content:** Implement features allowing users to add, edit, and delete their own recipes. This will involve creating forms and saving the data locally on the device.
3.  **Local Persistence:** Integrate a local database (like Room) to persist recipes, so users' data is saved between app sessions.
4.  **Enhanced Features:** Add more advanced functionality like recipe search, filtering by ingredients, and the ability to scale recipes.

## Technology Stack

This project is a practical example of a modern Android application and utilizes the following technologies:

*   **UI:** 100% Jetpack Compose for a declarative and reactive user interface.
*   **Architecture:** A single-activity architecture driven by the Navigation Compose library.
*   **Language:** Kotlin, including features like coroutines for asynchronous operations.
*   **Design:** Following Material Design guidelines to ensure a consistent and intuitive UI.

## Getting Started

To build and run the app, simply open the project in a recent version of Android Studio and click the "Run" button. The app should compile and run on an emulator or a connected Android device.
